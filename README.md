# Automatic-cancer-Detection
The aim of this software is to classify each row of the data matrix (representing the measurements of one patient). The algorithm you should use is explained in the appendix. The number of columns of the matrix learning_data and the matrix data must match. The number of rows of the matrix learning_data and the matrix learning_data_labels must also match. The matrix learning_data_labels and the matrix data_labels (the latter, generated by your software) must have a single column. The value of k cannot be larger than the number of rows in the matrix learning_data, and it must be positive (note: zero is not a positive number). Your software should follow the algorithm described in the appendix and generate a new matrix data_labels. This matrix should have a single column and the same number of rows as the matrix data. The entry (x,1) of the matrix data_labels will contain an integer representing the label of the row x of the matrix data. A zero means patient x does not have Cancer and a one means the opposite
